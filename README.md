I just completed the  analysis of HeroesOfPymoli.

From the analysis, it looks like there were  approximately 5 times more male players than the female ones. Also, male players purchased/spent more than the female players. Clearly, the age group of 20-24 has highest number of players. 

The two most purchased items are Final Critic and Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm.
